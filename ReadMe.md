This is going to be the start of a project that will really help me find frequencies of many different 
key phrases. It's similar to Cmd F, but instead of 1 phrase, I can search multiple and find the frequenceis
of all of them, and see how they map with each other. This way, I can see what parts of texts (whether it is 
a small website, or a large computer architecture textbook) talk about what I am searching for, rather than 
spending 30 minutes just scrolling through the Cmd F findings.

I hope this also finds some use for you as well.
